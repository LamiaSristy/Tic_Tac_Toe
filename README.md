# Tic_Tac_Toe
In this project I have created a very popular game, Tic-Tac-Toe. It consists of making a sequence of three symbols in either a row, column or diagonal in a 3x3 board, using Ruby OOP pronciples.

# How to play:
1. Enter the first player's name.
2. The firrst player enter the sign; This should only be one character.
3. Select the second player's name, following the instruction given on step 1. The names should be unique.
4. The second player gets to choose a sign but it has to be different from the first player's sign.
5. The game will begin. The Tic-Tac-Toe board will be printed with empty rows and columns.
6. To win this game one player must make a sequence of three signs either on rows, columns or diagonals.
7. The selected player gets to choose the position where they want to place their sign, by inputting a position. The input should be equal to or in between 1 to 9 integer values.
8. After that, the position will be validated and recorded. Afterwards, the second player will be selected to take a turn.
9. The selected position can't be chosen twice.
10. The game will take turns until a player wins or no more positions are available on the board, in this case it will be a draw.
11. The Game will ask to start again or not to the user.


## Game-Instruction:

This is a tic-tac-toe game built with ruby and oop principles:

    In this project, all the logic and manipulation are in the files inside lib folder.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this game project there are 3 main files 

    1- main.rb: This file is responsible for getting validated inputs from the user, outputting messages, and calling all the required methods.
    2- player.rb: This file is responsible for storing player variables such as (name, sign).
    3- board_game.rb: This file is responsible for the creating the board, and applying the coordinates.	  

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The game consists of 6 steps:
    1- get the players' names and validate that they are unique.
    2- get player one's sign and validate that it's a single character.
    3- get player two's sign and validate that it's a character and unique from player one's sign.
    4- display the board and ask for a move.
    5- validating the given move by checking that the coordinates are not already taken and that they are equal to or between 1-9. This process runs for both players.
    6- checks for the win conditions. If any player wins, it will display the player that won, else it will display "it's a draw".
    7- After the result the game asks if the player want to start again by inputting Y/N. If its a Y then it will start the game again.
